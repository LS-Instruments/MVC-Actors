MVC Actors Release Notes
v1.1.0
* Added the ability to finalize the initialization of views to provide means to the controller to generate events to the just initialized Views to update them about the current Controller status (Closes #4365)
* Added a feature by which a View can register for an event is such a way that, if such event was previously either broadcast by other Views or generated by the Controller, the Controller will generate the last broadcast/generated event to such View upon its initialization (Closes #4375)
* The Controller "Add Event.vi" method now is the public scope and a message was created. In this manner events can be created dynamically during Controller execution
